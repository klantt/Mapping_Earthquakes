# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Overview
  - This weeks I am working alongside Basil and Sadhana. Together we are showing the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. I will be tasked with showing a visual heat map of hot spots and and then pin point some specific locations. For this project I will be using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website. One last important note is that I will be using JavaScript and D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from GeoJSON data.
